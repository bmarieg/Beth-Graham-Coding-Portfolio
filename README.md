# Beth Graham
## Bioinformatics Coding Portfolio

Welcome!

I am using this repository as a coding and teaching portfolio. It is a work in progress!

### Table of Contents:

#### Coding:

- ["Search and Fetch from Entrez with Biopython"](https://github.com/bmarieg/Beth-Graham-Coding-Portfolio/blob/949dabb60c34dfda469bd6fc058f8b454cc93471/Search%20and%20fetch%20from%20Entrez%20with%20Biopython.ipynb):

  Jupyter notebook demonstrating how to use Biopython to access Entrez databases

- ["Rename Fasta Sequences for Easy-to-Read Phylogenetic Trees"](https://github.com/bmarieg/Beth-Graham-Coding-Portfolio/blob/949dabb60c34dfda469bd6fc058f8b454cc93471/Renaming%20Fasta%20sequences%20for%20easy-to-read%20phylogenetic%20trees.ipynb):

  Jupyter notebook demonstrating a Python function I wrote that:
    - Takes an input fasta file of protein sequences
    - Uses the UniProtKB ID mapping service to retrieve the gene name for each protein sequence
    - Uses the Entrez taxonomy database to retrieve the common name of the species of origin
    - Renames each Fasta sequences with the gene name, species name, and UniprotKB ID
    - Outputs a re-labeled Fasta file that can be used to generate easy-to-read multiple sequence alignments and phylogenetic trees

Coming soon:
- Interpreting RNA-Seq Data
- Using R
- Using R Markdown

#### Teaching:

I was teaching lab-based biology at Portland Community College when the world went in to quarantine. Along with my fellow instructors, I had to quickly adapt to teaching online. I developed a series of lecture videos covering the course textbook. Please keep in mind that these were developed on a time crunch during a global pandemic and without a lot of sleep. If you would like a short video, I recommend starting here: ["What is Science?"](https://youtu.be/r9BNrgbtHKU). The rest of my lecture videos are available on my YouTube channel, [@BethTeachesBio](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCIcvnv_qJ68ERMucXHt-dXg).

A while back, I started a blog with the intention of teaching bioinformatics in an approachable way. As you'll see, I didn't get very far, but you should get a sense of my style (plus I've got a cool URL): [bioinformatics.blog](https://bioinformatics.blog/)

#### Scientific Writing:

Here is a not-quite-finished draft of the first chapter of my PhD dissertation: ["Identifying the Common Components of Membrane Fusion Machines"](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1bUYGTsRMB0lVJzBC3nTN7hvt32DH5XRr/edit?usp=sharing&ouid=118309257677713383248&rtpof=true&sd=true). It is a sort of theoretical biology/review article. Not only is it obnoxiously long, but I decided to illustrate it.

Here is a term paper I wrote as a PhD student for a course in Comparative Reproduction: ["Why is Tetraspanin CD9 Essential for Murine Fertilization?"](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1M90gAly-qdR4Odhdg_seZO4lfe1Flz7A/edit?usp=share_link&ouid=118309257677713383248&rtpof=true&sd=true).

If you would prefer to download the Word documents directly, they are also included in this repository.

#### Illustration:

Just for fun, here is a random smattering of my illustrations: [Beth Graham - Illustration Styles](https://github.com/bmarieg/Beth-Graham-Coding-Portfolio/blob/c6617ababcca098ca55c235ed2004fee070f64b5/Beth%20Graham%20-%20Illustration%20Styles.ipynb)

Thanks for visiting!

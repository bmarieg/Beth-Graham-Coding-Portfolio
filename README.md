## Bioinformatics Coding Portfolio

Welcome!

I am using this repository as a coding portfolio (it is not intended as a software package). It is a work in progress!

Table of Contents:

- ["Search and Fetch from Entrez with Biopython"](https://github.com/bmarieg/Beth-Graham-Coding-Portfolio/blob/949dabb60c34dfda469bd6fc058f8b454cc93471/Search%20and%20fetch%20from%20Entrez%20with%20Biopython.ipynb):

  Jupyter notebook demonstrating how to use Biopython to access Entrez databases

- ["Rename Fasta Sequences for Easy-to-Read Phylogenetic Trees"](https://github.com/bmarieg/Beth-Graham-Coding-Portfolio/blob/949dabb60c34dfda469bd6fc058f8b454cc93471/Renaming%20Fasta%20sequences%20for%20easy-to-read%20phylogenetic%20trees.ipynb):

  Jupyter notebook demonstrating a Python function I wrote that:
    - Takes an input fasta file of protein sequences
    - Uses the UniProtKB ID mapping service to retrieve the gene name for each protein sequence
    - Uses the Entrez taxonomy database to retrieve the common name of the species of origin
    - Renames each Fasta sequences with the gene name, species name, and UniprotKB ID
    - Outputs a re-labeled Fasta file that can be used to generate easy-to-read multiple sequence alignments and phylogenetic trees

Coming soon:
- Interpreting RNA-Seq Data
- Using R
- Using R Markdown

I was teaching lab-based biology at Portland Community College when the world went in to quarantine. Along with my fellow instructors, I had to quickly adapt to teaching online. I developed a series of lecture videos covering the course textbook. Please keep in mind that these were developed on a time crunch during a global pandemic and without a lot of sleep. If you would like a short video, I recommend starting here: ["What is Science?"](https://youtu.be/r9BNrgbtHKU). The rest of my lecture videos are available on my YouTube channel, [@BethTeachesBio](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCIcvnv_qJ68ERMucXHt-dXg).



Thanks for visiting!

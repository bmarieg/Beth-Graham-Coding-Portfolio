# Python-for-Bioinformatics

Welcome!

This repository will be a combined portfolio and teaching tool. It is a work in progress!

Right now, all I have up here is a Jupyter Notebook demonstrating how to use Biopython to search the Entrez datbases and fetch individual sequences: Biopython_fetch_Entrez.ipynb

Thanks for visiting!

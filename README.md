## Bioinformatics Coding Portfolio

Welcome!

I am using this repository as a coding portfolio (it is not intended as a software package). It is a work in progress!

Table of Contents:

- "Search and Fetch from Entrez with Biopython":

  Jupyter notebook demonstrating how to use Biopython to access Entrez databases

- "Rename Fasta Sequences for Easy-to-Read Phylogenetic Trees":

  Jupyter notebook demonstrating a Python function I wrote that:
    - Takes an input fasta file of protein sequences
    - Uses the UniProtKB ID mapping service to retrieve the gene name for each protein sequence
    - Uses the Entrez taxonomy database to retrieve the common name of the species of origin
    - Renames each Fasta sequences with the gene name, species name, and UniprotKB ID
    - Outputs a re-labeled Fasta file that can be used to generate easy-to-read multiple sequence alignments and phylogenetic trees

Coming soon:
- Interpreting RNA-Seq Data
- Using R
- Using R Markdown


Thanks for visiting!
